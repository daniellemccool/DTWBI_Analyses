This folder contains the simulation study and analyses that led to Appendix A
in the paper Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human
mobility trajectories. 

To run the simulation study, call the file _00_single_threaded_sim_script.R with
all sets of varying parameters (n_imps, match.buffer, time.window, candidate
specificity).

The analysis of the relationships between the different parameters is documented
in _01_sim_parameter_analysis.R. The data are not made available due to their 
sensitive nature, but this file is made available for transparency.

Files haversine.cpp, query_setup.R, ref_setup.R and utils.R provide
supplementary functions necessary for the simulation study or analysis.
